To Do:
- incentive issues in the market
- simulate market
	- algs in Ash18 as baseline
	- extension to account for factors

Assumptions:
- start with paper

Incentives:
- super simplify and discuss incentives ** [week 9]

To Do:

Group:
- agree on assumptions baked into model

Simulator:
- write simulator

Algorithms:
- Ash18 ones
- wait time into value
- look-ahead **
- Stochastic departures from market **

Needs:
- Graph with weights ~ to some function of (distance, etc) [can be changed]
- Distribution of departure times baked into model
- "Look ahead" - keep track of nodes yet to be added
	-- queue of nodes to be added of length look_ahead_n


Timeline:
- Thu/Fri: Theo does simulator v1
- Weekend/Monday: Derek implements algs in Ash18
- Next week: Georgia and Emil implement extensions
- Week 9: reconvene & finalize assumptions, simple example, comparisons
- EOW 9: Poster, finish writup of simulations
- Week 10: Finish project report ~10pgs
